# New Solutions Enterprise New Product Launch

My project management project about a fictional software company's new product.

Challenge: Create a project management project including several necessary documents from the Businuess Case through Project Closure.

Context: I created a fictional organization called New Solutions Enterprise (NSE) whose project, called New Solutions Enterprise New Product Launch, was to roll out a new product in order to provide a solution to the company's declining sales, stagnation of innovation, and customer dissatisfaction. Using the concepts we learned throughout the semester, including the Software Development Lifecycle, stakeholder management, resource planning, resource gathering, risk management, quality and communications planning, as well as several others, this project is a collection of documents covering the majority of these topics.

Action: The new product being introduced to NSE's product line is a modification to their existing data analytics platform to include the integration of a third-party artificial intelligence (AI) tool. I am the project manager for this project and along with the many other made-up team members, I created a communication plan and team charter to show roles and responsibilites along with work needing to be accomplished in a Project Schedule and Work Breakdown Structure. There are also three project status reports showing progress at different stages in the project.

Result: Among the documents is an Earned Value Analysis report showing the progress of the project throughout its lifecycle. The graph in this document tells the story of the project being on budget through the selection of the AI tool and then running into problems when a backend compatibility issue causes the project to go over budget and fall behind schedule. Thankfully, corrective action is taken through a Change Request and the project is brought back on course to be a success in the end. The last documents include a Project Closure document as well as Lessons Learned.

Reflection: Before taking this course, I had little understanding of what being a project manager entailed. This project helped me learn the importance of measuring quality and allocating funds and resources in a responsible way as well as understanding and planning for risks accordingly.
